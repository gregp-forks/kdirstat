We would like to thank the following people:

- Alexander Rawass <alexannika@users.sourceforge.net> for implementing the
  first version of treemaps for KDirStat (this version has been completely
  replaced beginning May 2002).

- Ben Shneiderman for his ingenious idea of treemaps as an alternative and
  truly intuitive way of visualizing trees.

- All the people at the TU Eindhoven who worked on SequoiaView that gave us the
  inspiration for including treemaps in KDirStat and numerous papers describing
  the algorithms behind it.

- Harald Fernengel (harry1701@users.sourceforge.net) for continued support for
  integrating KDirStat with new Qt versions.

- Toyohiro Asukai <toyohiro@ksmplus.com> for Asian support patches.
