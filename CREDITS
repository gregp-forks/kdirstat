We would like to thank the following people:

- Ben Shneiderman for his ingenious idea of treemaps as an alternative and
  truly intuitive way of visualizing trees.

- All the people at the TU Eindhoven who worked on SequoiaView that gave us the
  inspiration for including treemaps in KDirStat and numerous papers describing
  the algorithms behind it.
