			     KDirStat - known bugs
			     =====================

Too many to list them all here yet...
;-)


Just kidding. Lots of stuff is still unfinished, so it might be a good idea
to just wait until everything is implemented and _then_ begin registering
bugs.

KDirStat shouldn't ever crash and dump core, however.
