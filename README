This is a graphical "du" (disk usage) display.

What you see here is a 90% rewrite - GUI, engine, everything.  The one thing it
can do a whole lot better than the old version is stay on one file system - the
single most most requested feature. Plus, it's way faster for large directory
trees - scanning an entire Linux file system no longer takes 30+
minutes. Rather, it's about 2-3 minutes: The old version seemed to have
problems with system buffer thrashing due to too many directories open for
reading at one time - the new version uses an internal queue and keeps only one
directory open.
