This is a graphical "du" (disk usage) display.
To read more about the predecessor, KDirStat-0.86, see

	www.suse.de/~sh/kdirstat

What you see here is a 90% rewrite - GUI, engine, everything.  The one thing it
can do a whole lot better than the old version is stay on one file system - the
single most most requested feature. Plus, it's way faster for large directory
trees - scanning an entire Linux file system no longer takes 30+
minutes. Rather, it's about 2-3 minutes (the old version seemed to have
problems with system buffer thrashing due to too many directories open for
reading at one time - the new version uses an internal queue and keeps only one
directory open).

Expect more docs when the program gets more mature. Until then, reat the old
docs (see URL above) - the principles are the same.

And yes, expect some really fancy stuff, too - tree maps, maybe even
beautifully rendered like in SequoiaView (this is a M$ Win program).

Stay tuned.
