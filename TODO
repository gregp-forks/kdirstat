Become KDirStat 0.86-compatible again:

- most menu stuff
- cleanup actions
- configure cleanups
- configure tree colors


New features:

- continue dir scanning at mount points at user request


Advanced stuff:

- tree maps
- cushioned tree maps
- squarified cushioned tree maps


Mabe if it turns out to be necessary:

- write scanned trees to cache file for later reuse
- use delayed dir tree scanning for seldom changed sys dirs
- let user choose (static) dirs to disregard
