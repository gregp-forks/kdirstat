			    TODO list for KDirStat
			   ========================
							Updated: 2003-01-04

- help text for "treemap" settings

- help text for "general" settings

- update screen shots in online help (no treemaps yet)

- make KDirStat a KPart

- colorize treemap tiles according to their MIME type / file pattern
  (e.g., all MP3s yellow, all PNGs blue, etc.)

- German translation for program



Maybe:
======

- let user configure cleanup action keyboard accelerators

- check in to the 'kdenonbeta' CVS - I don't like this part... ;-)

- German help file

- Animation other than pacman (optional?)

- configure mail report texts (the user gets an editor in the mailer anyway)

- 'kdf' like 'disk free' display for file system of current tree - pie, bar graph?
  Steal that thing from the SuSE YaST2 package manager UI I wrote?
  (which, in turn, I stole in large parts from KDirStat)

- Filter on tree view: by user, by mtime, by size

- Select items in the tree view as "special interest" for further processing in mail reports

- Manually mark dir subtrees as "static" - e.g., for system directories that
  almost never change anyway; scan them just once and save their sizes to file;
  only rescan those subtrees on explicit user request

- Automagically mark such subtrees by mtime and/or a hardwired list




Postponed until further notice:
===============================

- write scanned trees to cache file for later reuse;
  use this cache file first and then begin scanning the dir tree.

  Since the Linux 2.4 kernel is great at caching directory entries,
  this isn't really necessary for Linux - and I am a Linux guy...
  ;-)
