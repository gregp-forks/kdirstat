Become KDirStat 0.86-compatible again:

- most menu stuff
- cleanup actions
- configure cleanups
- configure tree colors


- Make treemaps work again; this will most likely require a rewrite of the
  treemap related part. 








Old ideas:

Advanced stuff:

- tree maps
- cushioned tree maps
- squarified cushioned tree maps


Mabe if it turns out to be necessary:

- write scanned trees to cache file for later reuse
- use delayed dir tree scanning for seldom changed sys dirs
- let user choose (static) dirs to disregard

But:
  The Linux 2.4 kernel is great at caching directory entries,
  thus for Linux this really isn't necessary - and I am a Linux guy...
