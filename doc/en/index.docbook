<chapter id="basic_usage">
<title>Basic Usage</title>

<sect1 id="invoking">
<title>Invoke &kdirstat;</title>

<para>
Start &kdirstat; from the KDE menu, right-click a directory in a
Konqueror window or type
<userinput>kdirstat</userinput> or
<userinput>kdirstat &lt;directory-name&gt;</userinput> in a shell
window or at KDE's <guibutton>Run command</guibutton> prompt
(<keycap>Alt-F2</keycap>).
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="select_dir">
<title>Select a Directory</title>

<para>
&kdirstat; will prompt for a directory if you didn't specify one when starting
it. You can specify local directories as well as URLs of remote locations -
<userinput>kdirstat /usr/lib</userinput> works as well as
<userinput>kdirstat ftp:/ftp.myserver.org/pub</userinput>.
</para>
<para>
In any case, &kdirstat; will start reading that directory. That might take a
while, but you can work with the program during all that time.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="find_out_where">
<title>Find out what Uses up all the Disk Space</title>

<para>
Look at the "Subtree Total" column or wait until a subtree is finished reading
and look at the graphical percentage bar display to find out what directory
subtee takes up how much disk space. Use the open / close icons (plus and minus
signs or small arrows, depending on how you set up your KDE) or double-click an
item to open or close it.
</para>
<para>
Notice how files at any directory level are kept apart from subdirectories -
there is a separate &lt;Files&gt; entry for them. This way, you can easily tell
how much disk space the files are using up in relation to the subdirectories
and their respective files.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="do_something">
<title>Do Something about it</title>

<para>
Once you found out where all your disk space goes, do something about it - this
is probably why you are using this program in the first place. You have several
options:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
Go to a computer hardware store and buy a new hard disk.
This is probably not what you want. ;-)
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Tell the owner of that file or directory to please clean up.
You can use &kdirstat; for that: Mark that file or directory (i.e., left-click
on it) and select <guibutton>Send Mail to Owner</guibutton>
from the context menu (right-click), from the tool bar (the envelope icon) or
from the <guibutton>Report</guibutton> menu.
</para>
<para>
A precomposed message will open in your
<link linkend="mail_client">favourite mail client</link>.
You can edit that text before actually sending it. The recipient of
the mail is the user who owns the file or directory you marked - but of course
you can edit that, too in the mail client.
</para>
<para>
The mail will contain those items that are currently displayed open from the
marked item on. If you want to include more items, open the respective
directories; if you want less, close them. Of course you can always delete
lines in the mail client if you find them irrelevant - there is no use
complaining about some 367 byte files along with others that take several
megabytes.
</para>

</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Invoke a "cleanup" action. There are several predefined ones, and you can
define your own. Use the context menu, the tool bar or the <guibutton>Clean
Up</guibutton> menu to find out which are available.
</para>
<para>
For some cleanup actions you will have to wait until the directory
tree is completely read until you can activate them. If a cleanup action
doesn't get enabled even then, the type of item you selected is inappropriate
for that kind of action: Some actions can only performed on directories, while
others can only be performed on files. Only very few actions work for
&lt;Files&gt; pseudo entries since they don't have a real counterpart in the
file system.
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</sect1>

</chapter>

<chapter id="predefined_cleanups">
<title>Predefined Cleanup Actions</title>

<para>
&kdirstat; comes with a number of predefined cleanup actions. You can configure
them all to your personal preference, and you can add your own. Here is what
the predefined cleanup actions do:
</para>

<sect1 id="cleanup_open_in_konqueror">
<title>Open in Konqueror</title>

<para>
This opens the selected item in a Konqueror window.
</para>
<para>
You can use Konqueror to delete it (but then, you can also do that more easily
from within &kdirstat;), you can move it to another place or you can examine it
more closely.
</para>
<para>
If the selected item is a known MIME type, this will open the appropriate
application. For example, if you invoke
<guibutton>Open in Konqueror</guibutton> on a PNG image, Konqueror will
immediately start an image viewer and display that image.
</para>
<para>
This is the Swiss army knife of cleanup actions: You can do a lot of different
things with it. Thus, &kdirstat; cannot know if and when it makes sense to
re-read that directory - you will have to do that manually:
Select <guibutton>Refresh selected</guibutton> from the context menu
(right-click) or from the <guibutton>File</guibutton> menu.
</para>
</sect1>


<sect1 id="cleanup_open_in_terminal">
<title>Open in Terminal</title>

<para>
This opens a terminal window in the directory of the selected item.
</para>

<para>
Use this to issue a few shell commands in that directory, then simply close
that shell window. You can easily open a new one in a different directory if
you need one, so you might want not to bother to repeatedly type
<userinput>cd</userinput> with lenghty paths - simply close that shell and open
a new one at the new location (type <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>-<keysym>T</keysym>.
</para>
<para>
As with the <guibutton>Open in Konqueror</guibutton> cleanup action described
above, you must manually re-read the directory's contents if you make
changes. Otherwise they will not be reflected in &kdirstat;'s display.
</para>
</sect1>


<sect1 id="cleanup_compress">
<title>Compress</title>

<para>
This compresses the selected directory to a .tar.bz2 archive.
</para>

<para>
For example, a subdirectory
<userinput>/work/home/kilroy/loveletters</userinput> will become a compressed
archive <userinput>/work/home/kilroy/loveletters.tar.bz2</userinput>.
The directory is removed once the compressed archive is successfully created
(but of course not if that failed).
</para>
<para>
Any existing archive of the same name will silently be overwritten.
</para>
<para>
Remember that Konqueror and related utilities can use that kind of archive
transparently; there is no need to unpack it if you want to read a file in that
archive. Simply click into the archive in Konqueror.
</para>

<para>
If you prefer .tgz archives to .tar.bz2, change the command line in the
<link linkend="configuring_cleanups">cleanup settings</link>. With .tar.bz2,
this is
</para>
<para>
<userinput>
cd ..; tar cjvf &percnt;n.tar.bz2 &percnt;n &amp;&amp; rm -rf &percnt;n
</userinput>
</para>
<para>
For .tgz archives, change this to
</para>
<para>
<userinput>
cd ..; tar czvf &percnt;n.tgz &percnt;n &amp;&amp; rm -rf &percnt;n
</userinput>
</para>
<para>
But you might think twice before doing that: "bzip2" (for .tar.bz2) compresses
a lot more efficient than ordinary "gzip" (for .tgz or .tar.gz), and most
systems support that just as well. It's just a matter of getting used to typing
<userinput>tar cjvf</userinput> rather than <userinput>tar czvf</userinput> for
creating an archive or <userinput>tar xjvf</userinput> rather than <userinput>tar
xzvf</userinput> for unpacking it.
</para>

</sect1>


<sect1 id="cleanup_make_clean">
<title>make clean</title>

<para>
This issues a <userinput>make clean</userinput> command in the selected
directory.
</para>
<para>
This is useful if you build software from source frequently. After successfully
installing the software (<userinput>make install</userinput>), there is no
need to keep the built binaries around in the source directory any longer. On
the other hand, people frequently forget to clean up those directories, so you
can do that from within &kdirstat; with a few mouse clicks.
</para>
</sect1>


<sect1 id="cleanup_clean_trash">
<title>Delete Trash Files</title>

<para>
This deletes files that are usually superfluous, such as editor backup files or
core dumps in the selected directory and in any of its subdirectories.
</para>
<para>
By default, the following types of files are deleted:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Object files left over from compiling software: *.o</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Editor backup files: *~ *.bak *.auto</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Core dump files: core</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
Of course, you can <link linkend="configuring_cleanups">configure this</link>
to suit your personal preferences.
</para>

</sect1>


<sect1 id="cleanup_delete_to_trash_bin">
<title>Delete (to Trash Bin)</title>

<para>
This invokes the KDE standard "delete" operation, i.e. the selected file or
directory is moved to the KDE trash bin.
</para>
<para>
Even though this doesn't help to reclaim disk space right away, it is a safe
method of deleting. Use this action for anything you want to get rid of and
then review your actions by looking into the KDE trash bin. If you are really
sure, select <guibutton>Empty Trash Bin</guibutton> there. Until that point,
you can always move those items back to where they came from.
</para>
<para>
You might consider not using this cleanup action if you are cleaning up a
directory on a different file system than your home directory: In that case
that "moving to trash" involves copying the items (and then deleting them at
the original location) which might take a while.
</para>
<para>
Notice that when moving an item to trash is not successful, &kdirstat; will
still falsely display that item as deleted even though it's still there. Use
<guibutton>Refresh selected</guibutton> from the context menu to update the
display manually. Read <link linkend="assume_deleted">here</link> why.
</para>
</sect1>


<sect1 id="cleanup_hard_delete">
<title>Delete (no way to undelete!)</title>

<para>
This is a real delete, not simply moving something to the trash bin. It's
quicker, and disk space is reclaimed immediately, but there is no way to
recover if you made a mistake. You will be prompted for confirmation when you
invoke this.
</para>
<para>
You can <link linkend="confirmation">change the configuration to not prompt for
confirmation</link>, but don't blame me if anything goes wrong after you did that.
</para>
<para>
As with <guibutton>Delete (to Trash Bin)</guibutton>, you will need to manually
re-read a directory if this went wrong (usually due to insufficient permissions)
- &kdirstat;'s display is out of sync with the hard disk if that happens.
Read <link linkend="assume_deleted">here</link> why.
</para>

<sect1 id="config_cleanups_reference">
<title>Reference</title>

<para>
Select the cleanup action you want to configure from the list at the left
side. You might need to check <guibutton>Enabled</guibutton> before you can
make any changes.
</para>

<para>
Enter a title in the <guibutton>Title</guibutton> field. You should mark one of
the characters in the title with an ampersand ('&amp;') to provide a keyboard
shortcut in the menus.
</para>

<para>
Enter a shell command in the <guibutton>Command line</guibutton> field. The
command will be invoked with <userinput>/bin/sh</userinput>, so you can use
everything the default shell provides - including pipelines, logical 'and' or
'or' ('&amp;&amp;' or '||', respectively) or multiple commands separated by
semicolons. Use '%p' for the full path (or URL) of the currently selected file
or directory or '%n' for the name without path.
</para>
<para>
&kdirstat;
will always change directory to the selected item, so there is no need to
manually add a <userinput>cd</userinput> command to the command line.
</para>
<para>
Commands are started in the background if possible, so don't add an extra
ampersand '&amp;'.
</para>

<para>
Check <guibutton>Recurse into subdirectories</guibutton> if the command should
be called for each subdirectory of the selected directory. Whether or not this
is useful depends on the kind of command you entered: A <userinput>make
clean</userinput> command usually takes care of that internally, while it's a
lot easier to use <userinput>rm -f *.bak</userinput> and let &kdirstat; handle
subdirectories rather than using a more complex <userinput>find ... | xargs
...</userinput> command.
</para>

<para id="confirmation">
Check <guibutton>Ask for confirmation</guibutton> if you want to prompt the
user for confirmation every time he invokes that cleanup action (but not for
each recursive subdirectory!). But beware: Having to confirm a lot of such
prompts tends to make users unattentive. They begin to blindly confirm
everything out of habit. Thus, use confirmations only when really necessary.
</para>

<para>
Check the category of objects this cleanup action works for. Not all commands
make sense for both files and directories. &lt;Files&gt; pseudo entries are a
very special case: They don't have a real counterpart on the hard disk. You can
safely check the &lt;Files&gt; category for actions that require changing
directory to somewhere and then execute a command there, but there is no use
trying to delete such a &lt;Files&gt; entry.
</para>

<para>
Choose between <guibutton>On local machine only ('file:/' protocol)</guibutton>
and <guibutton>Network transparent (ftp, smb, tar, ...)</guibutton>.
Most commands run locally only. There are only a few exceptions: For example,
you can open a remote location in many KDE applications, e.g., Konqueror.
</para>

<para>
Select a <guibutton>Refresh Policy</guibutton> to tell &kdirstat; how to update
its display after the cleanup action has been invoked:
</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<para>
<guibutton>No refresh</guibutton>: Don't refresh the display. Either the
cleanup action doesn't change the directory tree anyway or it is unknown when
or how - or you don't care.
</para>
<para>
Cleanup actions with this refresh policy are the only ones that can be invoked
while the respective directory subtree is being read. All others can only be
started once reading is finished.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
<guibutton>Refresh this entry</guibutton>: Refresh the directory branch the
cleanup action was selected with. This is the most useful refresh policy for
cleanup actions that delete a number of items from a directory tree, for
example <guibutton>Delete Trash Files</guibutton>.
</para>
<para>
If this refresh policy is selected, the command is not started in the
background: &kdirstat; has to wait for it to finish so the directory display
can be refreshed at the proper time.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
<guibutton>Refresh this entry's parent</guibutton>: Similar to
<guibutton>Refresh this entry</guibutton>, but one level higher up. Useful for
cleanup actions that delete the selected item but create a new one on the same
level, for example the <guibutton>Compress</guibutton> standard cleanup: The
original directory is deleted, but a .tar.bz2 file is created instead.
</para>
<para>
If this refresh policy is selected, the command is not started in the
background: &kdirstat; has to wait for it to finish so the directory display
can be refreshed at the proper time.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para id="assume_deleted">
<guibutton>Asume entry has been deleted</guibutton>: Don't really re-read
anything from disk, but assume the cleanup action deletes the selected
item, thus simply remove that item from the directory tree's representation in
&kdirstat;'s internal data structures.
</para>
<para>
This is much faster than any real refresh, but it might cause the internal data
structures to get out of sync with the hard disk if the cleanup action fails and
doesn't really delete the selected item. In this case, the user will have to
manually re-read that directory branch.
</para>
</listitem>

<title>Open in Emacs</title>

<para>
This is a trivial example that shows you how to add a new cleanup action that
opens a file in Emacs (or any other editor of your choice).
</para>

<para>
Select one of the unused user-defined cleanup actions from the list. Make sure
<guibutton>Enabled</guibutton> is checked.
</para>

<para>
Enter <userinput>Open in &amp;Emacs</userinput> in the

'E' as this cleanup action's keyboard shortcut.
</para>

<para>
Enter <userinput>emacs &percnt;p</userinput> in the <guibutton>Command
line</guibutton> field.
</para>

<para>
Leave both <guibutton>Recurse into subdirectories</guibutton> and
<guibutton>Ask for confirmation</guibutton> unchecked.
</para>

<para>
Make sure only <guibutton>Files</guibutton> is checked in the <guibutton>Works
for...</guibutton> section and <guibutton>Directories</guibutton> and
<guibutton>&lt;Files&gt; pseudo entries</guibutton> are unchecked. If you like
Emacs' "dired" mode very much, you can also leave
<guibutton>Directories</guibutton> checked, but it definitely doesn't make any
sense trying to open an editor with a &lt;Files&gt; entry.
</para>

<para>
Leave <guibutton>On local machine only</guibutton> selected. If you feel like
experimenting a lot, you can try setting up Emacs so it fetches files from
remote locations, but even then most likely only the 'ftp' protocol will work.
</para>

<para>
Leave the <guibutton>Refresh Policy</guibutton> at
<guibutton>No refresh</guibutton>. This ensures Emacs is started
in the background and you can continue working with &kdirstat; while Emacs
runs. It wouldn't make too much sense to change the command line to
<userinput>emacs &percnt;p &amp;</userinput> and change the refresh policy to, say,
<guibutton>Refresh this entry</guibutton>: The refresh would take place
immediately after Emacs starts, and this is probably not what you want.

<title>Compress</title>

<para>
This example explains the predefined <guibutton>Compress</guibutton> cleanup
action in more detail. Remember, this cleanup action makes a compressed
.tar.bz2 archive from a directory.
</para>

<para>
The <guibutton>Command line</guibutton> for this cleanup action is:
</para>

<para>
<userinput>
cd ..; tar cjvf &percnt;n.tar.bz2 &percnt;n &amp;&amp; rm -rf &percnt;n
</userinput>
</para>

<para>
<userinput>cd ..</userinput> changes directory one level up. We don't
want to do something in the selected directory, but one level higher.
</para>

<para>
The semicolon <userinput>;</userinput> tells the shell to execute one more
command - unconditionally, no matter if the previous command succeeded or
failed.
</para>

<para>
<userinput>tar cjvf &percnt;n.tar.bz2 &percnt;n &amp;&amp;</userinput>
is where the compressed .tar.bz2 archive is created. "c" is the tar command for
"create", "j" means "use bzip2 compression", "v" is "verbose" (even though this
is strictly spoken unnecessary here), "f" means use the next argument as the
target file name rather than some default tape device (which nowadays nobody
uses any more anyway). "&percnt;n.tar.bz2" will be expanded to the name of the
selected directory without path plus "tar.bz2", "&percnt;n" will be expanded to
the name without anything else. For a directory
<userinput>/usr/lib/something</userinput> all this will result in a command
</para>
<para>
<userinput>tar cjvf something.tar.bz2 something</userinput>
</para>

<para>
<userinput>&amp;&amp;</userinput> makes the shell execute the rest only if the
previous command (the <userinput>tar</userinput> command) is executed
successfully. This is used here to make sure the directory only is deleted if
we really have a .tar.bz2 archive with the same contents so we can easily
restore it when necessary. This is crucial in case there insufficient disk
space to create the archive or should we have insufficient permissions to
create the archive.
</para>

<para>
<userinput>rm -rf &percnt;n</userinput> recursively deletes the directory
without asking or complaining.
</para>

<para>
<guibutton>Works for...</guibutton> is enabled for directories only. Note it
wouldn't be a good idea to enable it for &lt;Files&gt; entries, too: The user
would rightfully expect the .tar.bz2 archive to contain the contents of the
&lt;Files&gt; entry only, i.e. only the files on that directory level. The
command would, however, pack the entire directory tree from the parent level on
into the .tar.bz2 file.
</para>

<para>
The <guibutton>Refresh Policy</guibutton> is set to
<guibutton>Refresh this entry's parent</guibutton> since not only the selected
item is changed, but its parent also: It loses one child (the directory) but
gets another one (the .tar.bz2 archive).
</para>

<para>
Please note that <guibutton>Recurse into subdirectories</guibutton> is not
checked here: the <userinput>tar</userinput> command and <userinput>rm
-rf</userinput> take care of any subdirectories.

alternatively in German).
</para>

<para>
Upon clicking on the <guibutton>Mail this...</guibutton> button, your
<link linkend="mail_client">mail client</link> opens with a
<link linkend="mail_example">precomposed mail</link>.
You can review that mail to make sure it doesn't contain anything you

With your opinion and your personal comments, you can make a contribution to
the Open Source movement - even if you are not a developer, even if you don't
have a clue how to improve or change the software. Your opinion is important,
even if you decide you don't like the program and send the mail off with "this
program is crap" checked.
</para>

<para>
Open Source softare lives and breathes with user feedback. If you miss a
feature, tell us about it. If you consider an existing feature confusing, tell
us about it. If you find an application overloaded with features so you can't
find the ones you really need, tell us about it.
</para>

<para>
On the other hand, if you like the program the way it is and you wouldn't like
to see it changed in any way, tell us about that, too. If you simply want to
thank those who go through the trouble writing all that software, do it. Your
input is appreciated, be it positive or negative.
</para>

<para>
There is nothing more frustrating for an Open Source software author than that
lingering uncertainty if there is anybody out there who actually uses his
program. He may not get any response from users - does that mean nobody
uses the software, or does it mean it simply runs so good nobody has reason to
complain? You can contribute by telling him he is doing all right and he should
keep up the good work.
</para>

<para>
In the opposite case, why not tell the author of a particular annoying program
just how annoying it is? This may shake him sober and make him reconsider his
work.

<para>
Your mail sent with <guibutton>Send Feedback Mail...</guibutton> is sent to the
authors of this program, to nobody else. No company or government institution
will get your mail address or any personal data. You might have noticed no
personal data are requested in the feedback form. In particular, you will never
receive spam e-mail of any kind because of sending feedback mail.
</para>

<para>
We, the authors of this program, loathe spam probably even more than the
average KDE user since we get so much of it - spam robots tend to extract
e-mail addresses from source code and from web pages, so you can be sure we do
our best to make life as hard as we can on the spammers and certainly not help
them in any way.
</para>

<para>
The purpose of all this feedback mail is to gather information about average
user satisfaction, about average opinions about an application's feature set,
an application's stability and learning curve. It's all about averages, thus no
specific user's data will ever be made available to the public - only
statistical averages over a large number of users, if at all.

Notice it's all plain ASCII. There is no attachment, no hidden header fields,
no information about your machine or yourself - only what you would send to
anybody else when you send a mail.
</para>

<para>
By the way, this is also why we kept the format that simple. Many developers
today prefer XML for all kinds of data, but the end user (you) should be able
to read and understand what you send - just so you can make sure you don't send
any information you'd rather keep to yourself.

<question>
<para>
Can I use &kdirstat; to sum up a directory on an FTP server?
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
Yes. Simply specify the URL at the command line or even in &kdirstat;'s
directory selection box:
<userinput>kdirstat ftp:/ftp.myserver.org/pub</userinput> (command line) or
<userinput>ftp:/ftp.myserver.org/pub</userinput> (directory selection box).
</para>
<para>
&kdirstat; supports all protocols that KDE supports. You can even use the "tar"
protocol (does it make any sense to do that? You decide). The only restriction
is that the protocol needs to support the "list directory" service - which not
all protocols do.
</para>
<para>
If you are unsure about the syntax to use, try it in Konqueror first and look
at Konqueror's URL line. For example, to figure out how to specify a "tar" URL,
click into a "tar" archive in Konqueror and look at the resulting URL to get an
idea of what it looks like.

</answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question>
<para>
Why does the "du" command sometimes report different
sizes than &kdirstat;?
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
There are different kinds of sizes reported by different kinds of system calls
or KDE services: The byte size and the block size.
</para>
<para>
The byte size is the exact number of bytes of a file or directory. This is what
&kdirstat; uses.
</para>
<para>
The block size is the number of disk blocks allocated by a file or
directory. Most "du" commands use that.
Depending on the type of file system, parts of the last block of a
file or directory may be unused, yet reserved for it anyway. If such a file system
uses 1024 byte blocks, a file will at least need those 1024 bytes, no matter if
it is 1024, 200 or even just one byte large. That depends on the file system type
and sometimes even on how this is set up - i.e., this is highly system
specific.
</para>
<para>
&kdirstat; uses the byte size since this the only size that is reliably
returned by all kinds of system calls and KDE services alike. It only really
makes a difference in very pathological situations anyway, for example if you
have subdirectories with a large number of tiny files.
